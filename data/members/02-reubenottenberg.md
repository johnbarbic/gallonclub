#### Hi!

I'm Reuben, and I'm the person that performed the first blood transfusion in 1907 using blood typing and matching.  I'm an honorary member of the Gallon Club and was the first to be awarded the Karl Landsteiner Award from the American Society of Blood Banks for "distinguished pioneering contributions to blood banking and hemotherapy.".  You can read more about me on my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_Ottenberg" title="Reuben Ottenberg" class="link">Wikipedia page</a>.
