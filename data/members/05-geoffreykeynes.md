#### Cheers!

I'm Geoffrey, I developed an expertise in blood transfusion during World War 1 and created the first portable transfusion kit.  I also established co-founded London's Transfusion service after the war and published the first british book on Blood Transfusion.  I'm an honorary member of the Gallon Club and also just happened to have been married to Darwin's (yes, That One) granddaughter.  You can read more about me on my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Keynes" title="Geoffrey Keynes" class="link">Wikipedia page</a>.
