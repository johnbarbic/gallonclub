#### Hey!

I'm Rich, and I'm the person that made blood transfusion practical by discovering the optimal use of sodium citrate to prevent donated blood from clotting.  I'm an honorary member of the Gallon Club and did some other really cool stuff.  You can read more about me on my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lewisohn" title="Richard Lewisohn" class="link">Wikipedia page</a>.
