#### Hi!

I'm Karl, and I'm the person that distinguished the primary blood groups in 1900 and further distinguished their Rh groups with others later in the 1900's.  I'm an honorary member of the Gallon Club.  You can read much more about me on my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Landsteiner" title="Karl Landsteiner" class="link">Wikipedia page</a>.
