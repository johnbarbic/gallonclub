After I finished the official tutorial, I began exploring the starters. Some starters were simple and others were very complex. For example, [Greg Lobinski's Hero Starter](https://gatsby-starter-hero-blog.greglobinski.com/) looked fanatistic to me, but overwhelming in terms of the underlying familiarity with both Gatsby and React. For someone new to this ecosystem there really wasn't anything between the official tutorial and a fully loaded application. 

####A Little Background

By day I typically work on large ERP systems that are composed of a lot of legacy code which predates React. I was new to React and wanted to play around in a greenfield project of my own. When I discovered Gatsby, I immediately thought of it as a gateway to that experience. My first impression of Gatsby was pure joy. As anyone who works in technology may tell you, that kind of feeling is a special commodity in development. Delivery teams nurture joy by learning and creating together and that has been my experience with Gatsby.  

####What is The Gallon Club?

As I wrote in the About page, The Gallon Club is kind of "meta."  It's an example web application, dedicated to blood donation, that also shows how it was developed.  It's more complex than the official tutorial but not as complex as many of the starters. I am a life long blood donor and this project is my way of combining my vocation with something I am passionate about. This application was written to explore file system storage in depth and many of the Gatsby basics like image processing.  I created it while taking the next step after completing the official Gatsby tutorial, and I hope it's useful for others. After all, Gatsby is one of those pieces of technology that makes the complex simpler so you can go about the business of making the web a better place.  I know that sounds corny, but there are others out there that feel the same way:

  <i>"...she raised us with one pretty simple principle: if you could see a better world, you were morally obligated to help bring it into existence. That you should put your time, your energy, your passion, your intellect, your heart, your soul, everything on the line. You shouldnâ€™t sit on the sidelines, you should actively advocate for the world you wanted to see, and that world should be one that was better for many, not just for you."</i></p>

By the time you are finished with this site it's my hope that you will see that Gatsby, together with Netlify, lower the barriers to website development pretty dramatically and make that kind of thing more possible than ever.
