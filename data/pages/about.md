### Blood Donation
Blood transfusion in the modern sense of the word didn't get its start until 1907 when the first blood transfusion using blood type matching was performed by Reuben Ottenberg.  And it didn't really take off until World War I when the ability to prevent blood clotting and store blood for a length of time was successfully developed.  In the interveening years the development of blood banks along with our ability to break plasma into products for clinical use has saved countless lives including my own. 

Here are some basic facts about blood donation in the United States:  According to the Red Cross someone needs blood every two seconds for surgeries, traumatic injury, and other treatments. Blood and platelets cannot be manufactured or grown and can only come from volunteer donors.  Each donation can save up to three lives, but here is the thing,  Less than 38% of us are elible to donate blood.  Meaning, less than 38% of the population is in sufficiently good health to donate.  This is why it's important to donate blood and advocate whenever you can.   If you are able it's good to pay it forward donate when you are young and healthy, and encourage others so that when the time comes there will be plenty blood on hand.

### The Gallon Club

The Gallon Club is an open source website built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).  It's a club for people committed to giving a gallon of blood during their lifetimes.  Rather than develop just another blog tutorial, I decided to create a live application that would my way of advocating for a good cause and compel me to go beyond the basics of the official Gatsby tutorial.  The website is composed of several pages, a blog, membership list, and member pages. It expands on the official tutorial by exploring file system storage in more detail, and shows how to incorporate common bits of functionality along the way.

Starting with the default starter, the blog provides a step by step guide to creating the very website you are reading. To follow along it is best if you have worked through the official [tutorial](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) so that you are already familiar with commands like "gatsby develop" and have a basic understanding of how things work. I don't pretend to be a great writer of tutorials, but I think there is value to writing things down when you are learning something new and it wasn't that much work to create a live site out of all of that experience so I did.      

I really enjoy learning and using Gatsby.  It makes it easy to create a high performance web applications that have mobile web baked in from the start.  The Gallon Club for example will run just as fast on a tablet or a phone as it does on the desktop, which is fantastic.  Also, the Gatsby development experience is fun.  I hope that comes across as you read through the blog posts.  Now that it's reached a deployable state I look forward to evolving it.  I don't know where this will go, but I look forward to finding out. The technologies behind this project are evolving and so will this little example.
